# Wut?!
We are looking for a new members for our team. So, in order to know you a little bit we have created a challenge.

# Our challenge
We are looking to a way that allows us to fetch our favorites movies from **omdbapi**, and mark them as favourites.

## Brief
- The app must have a basic form with a "search field" and a button "search"
- When a user completes the movie name (or part of it) in the field "search field" an press the button "search". The app must connect to http://www.omdbapi.com/, fetch and display the results.
- Every result must have a button to mark (or remove) them as favourite in our database.
- The favourites movies must have their own view as a list.
 
# The rules ðŸ‘€
- Fork this repository and create a PR
- Use any framework and language as you want 
- You can use any kind of platform to deploy (if you want) i.e.: heroku, gcp, aws, vps etc.
- You should give us a URL to view the result (duh).


# Time
- You have 6 days as maximum but if you need more time, don't worry push your changes! is more important the quality.
